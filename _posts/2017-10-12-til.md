### Alphabetical sorting in Vim

This might be obvious, but it blew my mind today. Say you need to order something alphabetically, like [propTypes on a react component](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react/blob/a120758e25f04cdc37d2d3d80922f2b998ab63ed/docs/rules/jsx-sort-props.md). Just select the block of text in visual mode (Shift + v) and type `:sort`.
