When using react to control checkboxes, Safari (and maybe Chrome) can have a weird flickering effect as you toggle their state. I tried changing the handler to `onClick`, tried doing `preventDefault`, and tried switching back to `onChange` â€” no luck.

Was finally able to get it to stop flickering by using [custom styled checkboxes](http://wtfforms.com) that are css only.
