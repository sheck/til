## Testing credit card autofill locally

Recently worked on a project that needed to work with credit card autofill. Unfortunately, most browsers will not autofill unless the server uses https -- a problem if you are trying to develop locally.

I found that if you use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) you can create a local tunnel that uses https. Also, it seems like it works with livereload as well.

    $ gulp serve
    $ ngrok http 9000
    open the https tunneled URL
