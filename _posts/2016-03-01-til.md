Unless you want to install [hub](https://github.com/github/hub), transferring commits from one similar repo to another is a pain.

1. Add `.patch` to your github url for the commit, to download it as a formatted patch.
2. Save to the folder of the other repo (and maybe rename it, too).
3. In that folder run `git am your_patch_name.patch`
