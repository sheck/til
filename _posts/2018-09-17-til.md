### Bulk renaming in Zsh

I needed to rename a bunch of React components inside of subdirectories from — for example — `event.js.jsx` to `event.js`. Instead of doing a loop or
passing commands to `find`, you can do it easily with `zmv`.

```shell
autoload zmv
# Do a dry run to see how files would be renamed
zmv -n '(**/)(*).js.jsx' '$1$2.js'
# Do the actual renaming
zmv '(**/)(*).js.jsx' '$1$2.js'
```
